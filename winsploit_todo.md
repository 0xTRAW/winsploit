This is what Winsploit(v.1.0) should be able to do on the target remote system
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1) Execute system commands
 2) Donwload files
 3) Upload files
 4) Create/detele files
 5) Change target system wallpaper
 6) take screenshots
 7) display system information
 8) Reconnect after every 10 (useful for creating percistance payload/backdoor)
 9) Persistant backdoor/payload (you can still get the connection even if the victim restarts his/her pc)
 10) dump recently wireless/wifi passwords
 
 # cool more features to come with the later version(v.2.1), you can suggest some cool features you want me to add, to improve your hacking and pentesting experience, happy hacking!!!!!!
